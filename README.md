# Point Set Topology

Notes on point-set topology (also known as general topology or elementary topology).

The point of this project is to cover the prerequisites for reading  
<a href='https://archive.org/details/largescalestruct0000hawk/page/n5/mode/2up'><em>The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time</em></a>, 
by Hawking and Ellis (1973).

No proofs. Just definitions and basic results, to help me learn the lingo and the basic ideas. 

The files are entirely in HTML and CSS.

The content is deployed <a href='https://johanley.github.io/topology/'>here at github</a>.
