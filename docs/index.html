<h1>Point-Set Topology</h1>
Notes on the subject of <b>point-set topology</b>.
 
<P>This project exists in order to help me read 
<a href='https://archive.org/details/largescalestruct0000hawk/page/n5/mode/2up'><em>The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time</em></a>, by Hawking and Ellis.
From the first chapter of the book:
<P><em>"While we expect that most of our readers will have some acquaintance with General Relativity, we have endeavoured to write this book so that it is 
self-contained apart from requiring a knowledge of simple calculus, algebra, and point set topology."</em>

<P>Because I lack the necessary background in point-set topology, I have created these notes to help me understand the subject.

 <P><b>Warnings:</b>
  <ul>
   <li>The jargon used by mathematicians is not universal. Variations exist, and those variations can sometimes be very confusing.
   <li>It's impossible to take account of all variations in jargon. 
   <li>Here, <em>function</em> is more specific than a <em>map</em>: a <em>function</em> is a <em>map</em> whose codomain is the real numbers.
   This is how Hawking and Ellis define map and function. 
   Some authors treat <em>function</em> as a synonym for <em>map</em>. 
   <li>The term <em>range</em> is not used here. It has fallen out of fashion, because of its ambiguous use.
   <li>The term <em>neighbourhood</em> is dangerous because its definition has many variations. Hawking and Ellis use 'neighbourhood', 'coordinate neighbourhood', 
   'open neigbourhood', 'normal neighbourhood'. Gemignani: he uses 'D-p-neighbourhood' or 'p-neighbourhood' for an open ball. Very confusing!
   <li>sometimes 'neighbourhood of x' means 'an open set that has x', sometimes it means 'a set that contains an open set that has x'.
   <li>The terms I use below are of course not exhaustive. Mathematicians define other terms that are not referenced here.
   <li>In this subject, it's often the case that multiple equivalent definitions of things are possible.
   <li>The terms T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>/Hausdorff have uniform definitions amongst authors. 
        But there's wide variation in the rest of the separation-terms: T<sub>3</sub>, T<sub>4</sub>, <em>normal</em>, and <em>regular</em>. Confusing!

<P>Remarks:
 <ul>
 <li>For many books, the approach is to generalize aspects of metric spaces into aspects of topological spaces.
 <li>Classical physics needs continuity on space and time. 
    It's important that continuity is expressible using the open sets of chosen topologies. 
    That is, continuity depends on the chosen topologies.
    Note as well that defining continuity with open sets differs in character from defining with epsilons and whatnot. 
    At the level of open sets, the language takes on a 'non-local' character.
 <li>homeomorphic map: both the map and its inverse exist (bijective), and both are continuous: they preserve topological properties.
 <li>the subset topology is important for physics, where you restrict a topological space to a subset, and use intersections with open sets. 
   When a continuous map is restricted to some part of the domain, the restricted map is still continuous.    
</ul>

<P>It's important to clearly understand the relation between metric spaces and topological spaces:
<ul>
 <li>every metric space is a topological space
 <li>more specifically, <b>every metric space is a paracompact Hausdorff topological space</b>
 <li>a metric induces a topology 
 <li>different metrics may or may not induce the same topology
 <li>it's always possible to add a metric to a topological space; but adding a metric can change the topology!
 <li><b>metrizable</b>: a topological space is metrizable only if a metric can be added to it without changing the topology
 <li><b>a metric space has a notion of distance, while a topological space only has a notion of closeness</b>
</ul>

<P>Properties of topological spaces are unchanged by homeomorphic maps:
<ul>
 <li>convergence
 <li>compactness
 <li>continuity
 <li>connectedness
 <li>dimension
</ul>

<P>Properties of metric spaces:
<ul>
 <li>completeness
 <li>uniform continuity
 <li>uniform convergence
 <li>Hausdorff dimension
</ul> 

<P>Quotes from <em>A First Course in Topology</em>, R. A. Conover, 1975.

<P><em>For example, there is a continuous function from the knot (A) below onto the circle (B), even though the knot must be torn, untwisted, and then repaired to
transfrom it onto the circle. The important thing for such a function to be continuous is that the cut made in the knot is repaired before the function
is finished.</em> [Not just 'rubber sheet' transformations, but cuts/identifications as well.]

<P><em>...sequence can converge to more than one point...</em> [In some cases.]

<P><em>Closed sets are just as important in topology as open sets are.</em>

<P><em>Thus a function is continuous if and only if its inverse preserves closed sets, and a function is continuous if and only if it preserves open sets.
Both of these statements rank among the most important in point-set topology. Sometimes one of them is easier to use than the other, and you should 
remember them both.</em>

<P>The <b>empty set</b> ∅:
<ul> 
 <li>contains nothing. 
 <li>is a subset of every set. 
 <li>is used by fundamental math to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number#Von_Neumann_definition_of_ordinals'>build up structure</a> 'out of nothing' (<b>strange!</b>)
 <li>has {∅}  as its power set.
</ul>

<P>In any topological space, the empty set ∅: 
<ul> 
 <li>is both open and closed
 <li>is compact (because it's finite) 
 <li>has the empty set as its closure
</ul>


<P>The <b>cardinality</b> of a set S: 
<ul> 
 <li> is the number of items in the set.
 <li> is denoted |S|.
 <li> is determined by a one-to-one correspondence with another set.
</ul>

<P>The cardinality of the natural numbers N = {0,1,2,...} is used to categorize the cardinality of a set:
<ul> 
 <li> a set S is <b>countable</b> iff |S| &le; |N|; otherwise it's <b>uncountable</b>.
 <li> if the equality applies, then S is <b>countably infinite</b>.
</ul>

Countable:
<ul> 
 <li> integers
 <li>even integers
 <li>rational numbers
 <li>algebraic numbers (root of a polynomial with integer coefficients).
 <li>an infinite subset of a countable set  
 <li>the Cartesian product of two countable sets
 <li>the union of finitely many countable sets  
</ul>

Uncountable:
<ul>
 <li> transcendentals (non-algebraics)
 <li> irrationals
 <li> reals
 <li> complex numbers
 <li> the set of infinite sequences of 1s and 0s
 <li> a superset of an uncountable set 
 <li> the power set of an infinite set, e.g. P(N)
 <li> the set of functions from N to N
</ul>

Between any two distinct real numbers:
<ul>
 <li> there are infinitely many rational numbers
 <li> there are infinitely many irrational numbers
</ul>

<P>The cardinality of a power set is an important idea:
<ul>
 <li> |P(S)| is always bigger than |S|
 <li> in general, there's no <em>onto</em> function from S to P(S). 
 <li> |P(N)| = |R| is an interesting fact (N is natural numbers, R is reals).
 <li> taking successive power sets gets you bigger and bigger cardinality.
 <li> the <b>continuum hypothesis</b> states that there are no numbers between |N| and |R|.
</ul>

<P><b>Strange</b>: The cardinality of a line segment matches the cardinality of: 
<ul>
 <li> an infinite line
 <li> the entire plane
 <li> any R<sup>n</sup> space!
</ul>

<P><b>Subset</b>: 
<ul>
 <li>variations in the symbol used, ⊂ versus ⊆.  I prefer ⊂.
 <li>variations: some use the idea of a <em>proper</em> subset, while others simply ignore the distinction.
 <li><b>equal sets</b>: A = B iff A ⊂ B and B ⊂ A.
 <li>the <b>power set</b> P(A) of A is the set of all subsets of A. If A has n items, then P(A) has 2<sup>n</sup> items.
 <li>a <b>partition</b> of A is a set of subsets of A, which divide up the contents of A among themselves, without duplicating any item.
</ul> 

<P>The <b>complement</b> of B in A is A - B: the items in A that aren't in B.

<P>The <b>intersection</b> of multiple sets {S<sub>i</sub>} can be written using the integers as an <b>index set</b>: 
<ul>
  <li>⋂{S<sub>i</sub>|i ∈ I}
  <li>⋂<sub>I</sub>S<sub>i</sub>
  <li>other variations exist
</ul>
Sets are <b>disjoint</b> if their intersection is empty.

<P>The <b>union</b> of multiple sets {S<sub>i</sub>} can be written as: 
<ul>
  <li>∪{S<sub>i</sub>|i ∈ I}
  <li>∪<sub>I</sub>S<sub>i</sub>
  <li>other variations exist
</ul>

<P>The <b>Cartesian product</b> of two sets A and B  
<ul>
  <li>is denoted A x B.
  <li>consists of the set of all <em>ordered pairs</em> (a,b) of items from A and B.
  <li>note that the items in A x B are ordered pairs, and are not the same type of object as the items in A and B.
</ul>

<P>A <b>relation</b> R between A and B:
<ul>
 <li>is a subset of their Cartesian product: R ⊂ A x B.
 <li>defines a "direction", from A to B, with no other structure.
 <li>if (a,b) is an ordered pair in R, then we can write <em>aRb</em>, or say that a and b are R-related.
 <li>always has an <b>inverse relation</b>: all of the (b,a) pairs corresponding to each (a,b) pair.
 <li>the set B can be the same as the set A (a relation on A).
</ul>

<P>A <b>partial ordering</b> on set S is a relation on S.
<ul>
 <li>each ordered pair (a,b) in the relation has a &le; b.
 <li>symbolically, you can think of a &le; b as standing in for (a,b).
 <li>the &le; sign is treated generically: it can refer to <em>numeric comparisons</em> or to <em>taking a subset</em> (and maybe other operations?).
 <li>not every pair of items is necessarily comparable.
</ul>

<P>A partial ordering satisfies these rules that apply to real numbers R, and are taken as a prototype:
<ul>
 <li>x &le; x, for all x ∈ R
 <li>(x &le; y and y &le; x) implies x = y, for any x,y ∈ R
 <li>(x &le; y and y &le; z) implies x &le; z, for any x,y,z ∈ R
</ul>

<P>For any set S, the ⊂ operation defines a partial ordering on its power set P(S).

<P>A partially ordered set S,&le; allows for possible upper and lower bounds on the items in W ⊂ S.
<ul>
 <li>the <b>upper/lower bound</b> is in S (not necessarily W).
 <li>not every subset W of a partially ordered set will have an upper or lower bound.
 <li>for example, the open interval (0,1) has no upper or lower bounds.
 <li>W is a <b>chain</b> if W is totally ordered by the ordering induced on it by S.
</ul>
 
<P>Related ideas:
<ul>
 <li><b>greatest lower bound</b> [glb, infinum, inf].
 <li><b>least upper bound</b> [lub, supremum, sup].
 <li>again, these items are in S, not necessarily in W ⊂ S.
 <li>if S is the reals: if a lower (upper) bound exists, then there is a glb (lub).
</ul>

<P>A <b>total ordering</b> is simply an ordering that is applicable to all items in the given set.
Given a partially ordered set S,&le; and a subset W ⊂ S:
<ul>
 <li>W is a <b>chain</b> if W is totally ordered by the ordering induced on it by S.
</ul>

<P>An <b>equivalence relation</b> E on a set S is a relation on S:
<ul>
 <li>numeric equality = is taken as its prototype (just as &le; is the prototype for partial ordering relations).
 <li>each ordered pair (a,b) in the relation has a E b.
 <li>symbolically, you can think of a E b as standing in for (a,b).
</ul>
 
<P>An equivalence relation E on a set S satisfies these rules (similar to partial ordering, except for the second rule):
<ul>
 <li>sEs, for all s ∈ S
 <li>if sEs', then s'Es
 <li>if sEs' and s'Es'', then sEs''
</ul>

<P>Partitions and equivalence relations are closely related.
An equivalence relation on S can be used to <em>induce a partition</em> on S, where each set in the partition contains equivalent items.
Conversely, given any partition of S, you can define an equivalence relation E such that E induces the given partition. 
 
<P>For a set S, the set of items equivalent to s is called the <b>E-equivalence class</b> of s (under the given equivalence relation E).
This is often abbreviated to simply <b>equivalence class</b>.
 
<P>A <b>map</b> m: A ➔ B is a relation in which every <em>a</em> appears exactly once:
<ul>
 <li>A is called the <b>domain</b>.
 <li>B is called the <b>codomain</b> [sometimes range].
 <li>the map <em>m</em> is said to be a map <b>into</b> the codomain (as opposed to <em>onto</em> - see below).
 <li>a map always uses all of its domain set (no left-vees), but not necessarily all of its codomain set (possible right-vees).
 <li>for each pair <em>(a, b)</em>, <em>b</em> is called the <b>image</b> of <em>a</em>, and <em>a</em> is called the <b>preimage</b> of <em>b</em>.
 <li>the image of the map <em>m(A)</em> is the set of all <em>b</em>'s involved in the relation.
 <li><b>onto [surjective]</b>: the image of the map <em>m</em> is the entire codomain, m(S) = T.
 <li><b>one-to-one [injective]</b>: no right-vees, <em>b</em>'s aren't repeated in the relation.
 <li><b>one-to-one correspondence [bijective]</b>: both onto and one-to-one.
</ul>

<P>A one-to-one correspondence is always <b>invertible</b>, and vice versa. 

<P>In physics, I think most maps are invertible.

<P>The inverse <em>relation</em> m<sup>-1</sup> always exists; the inverse <em>map</em> m<sup>-1</sup> exists only if it is a one-to-one correspondence.

<P>A map can be <b>restricted</b> to a subset of the domain, to produce a slightly different map: 
<ul>
 <li>m: A ➔ B
 <li>subset of the domain W ⊂ A
 <li>(m|W) is the restriction of m to the subset W: (m|W): W ➔ B
 <li>sometimes it's written without the parens: m|W.
</ul>
 
<P>Two (or more) maps can be chained together to make a <b>composite map</b>, if the codomain of one map is the domain of another:
<ul>
 <li>p: A ➔ B
 <li>q: B ➔ C
 <li>(q ∘ p) : A ➔ C
</ul>

<P>Names for different kinds of maps: 
<ul>
 <li>a <b>function</b> m: A ➔ R has the codomain as the reals R.
 <li>a <b>sequence</b> m: N ➔ B has the domain {1,2,3,...}.
 <li>an <b>index</b> m: I ➔ B uses its domain I (the index set) to label the items in a set B.
 <li>the <b>identity map</b> <em>id</em> : X ➔ X simply maps its input to itself: input equals output.
</ul>
 
 <P>The <b>axiom of choice</b> means that, given some family of sets, you can create a new set by <em>choosing one (and only one) item from each set</em>.
 It's an axiom, so it's an unproven assumption.
 This can be stated using a map, like so: 
<ul>
 <li>given {S<sub>i</sub>}, i ∈ I is a family of non-empty sets. 
 <li> there is a map m: I ➔ ∪<sub>I</sub> S<sub>i</sub>, such that m(i) ∈ S<sub>i</sub> for each i.   
</ul>
<P>There are several equivalent formulations of the axiom of choice. 


<P>A <b>metric</b> D: X x X ➔ R is a generalized distance function defined on a set X, which has: 
<ul>
 <li>D(x,y) &ge; 0 
 <li>D(x,y) = 0 iff x = y
 <li>D(x,y) = D(y,x)
 <li>D(x,z) &le; D(x,y) + D(y,z) the triangle inequality
</ul>

<P>A <b>metric space</b> X,D is a set X together with a chosen metric on X. 
A subset of X will also be a metric space, with an <b>induced metric</b>.  

<P>A metric can be defined on various kinds of things:
<ul>
 <li>numbers
 <li>functions
 <li>sequences
 <li>...other...
</ul>

<P>Examples of the interpretation of the return value of a metric:
<ul>
 <li>a distance
 <li>an angle
 <li>Hamming distance between two strings of the same length (number of characters that need to be changed)
 <li>...other...
</ul>

<P>Examples of a metric:
<ul>
 <li>the <b>discrete metric</b> [trivial metric]: D(x,y) = 1 iff x &ne; y; D(x,x) = 0. Can be used with any set X.
 <li>the <b>Euclidean metric</b> on R<sup>n</sup>
 <li>the <b>absolute value metric</b> on R: for the reals, the Euclidean metric can be restated as |x - y|
 <li>the <b>taxicab metric</b> on R<sup>2</sup>: |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|
 <li>a vector space with a norm ||v||, is a metric space with ||x - y|| as the metric
</ul>

<P>The <b>diameter d(A)</b> of a subset of a metric space X is defined like this:
<ul>
 <li>X,D is a metric space.
 <li>A ⊂  X. 
 <li>the diameter d(A) of A is the least upper bound (max) of all possible distances between points in A. 
 <li>that is, d(A) = lub {D(x,y)|x,y ∈ A}.
</ul>

<P>In a similar way, you can define the <b>distance</b> between two subsets, or between a point and a set, as being a greatest lower bound (glb).


<P>An <b>open/closed ball</b> is analogous to an open/closed interval on the real line: 
<ul>
 <li>X,D is a metric space
 <li>given a point p and a distance value r (a radius)
 <li>an open ball of radius r at p is {x∈X | D(p,x) &lt; r} = B(p;r) = B<sub>r</sub>(p)
 <li>a closed ball of radius r at p is {x∈X | D(p,x) &le; r} = B[p;r] = B<sub>r</sub>[p] 
</ul> 
Sometimes the B-notation has a symbol for the metric added to it, to remove ambiguity.

<P>Note that Gemignani refers to this idea as a D-p-neighbourhood, or p-neighbourhood.
This seems to go against common convention.
Common convention defines a neighbourhood thusly: a set N is a neighbourhood of x if N contains on open set that in turn contains x.
 
<P>An <b>open set</b> contains an open ball around every point:
<ul>
 <li>X,D is a metric space
 <li>S ⊂ X is as subset of X
 <li>if for every p ∈  S, there's an open ball of some radius r B(p;r) ⊂ S
 <li>then S is an open set 
</ul> 

 
<P>A <b>closed set</b> is the X-complement of an open set. There are four possibilities for a subset S ⊂ X: 
<ul>
 <li>both open and closed
 <li>neither open nor closed
 <li>only open
 <li>only closed
</ul>

<P>Again, these are specific to a metric, so sometimes the notation can make the metric explicit.

<P>Open and closed sets on a metric space <b>follow the same rules that later define a topological space</b>.

<P>Open sets: the following are true for a metric space X, D:
<ul>
 <li>X and ∅ are open sets 
 <li>the intersection of any two open sets is also an open set 
 <li>the union of any (possibly infinite) family of open sets is also an open set
</ul> 
 
<P>Closed sets: the following are true for a metric space X, D (note than union and intersection are interchanged!):
<ul>
 <li>X and ∅ are closed sets 
 <li>the union of any two closed sets is also a closed set 
 <li>the intersection of any (possibly infinite) family of closed sets is also a closed set
</ul> 


<P>The distance between a closed set and any element of its complement is always greater than 0:
<ul>
 <li>X, D is a metric space
 <li>S ⊂ X is a subset of X
 <li>S is closed iff any point x in its complement (X - S) has D(x,S) > 0
 <li>that is, a closed set contains all points that are 0 distance from it
</ul>

<P>The <b>closure</b> of a set has all points having zero distance from the set:
<ul>
 <li>X,D is a metric space
 <li>S ⊂ X is a subset of X
 <li>the closure of S is Cl S = {x ∈  X | (D(x,S) = 0}
 <li>Cl S is a closed set
 <li>Cl S contains the set S, plus any other points that have 0 distance from S
 <li>Cl S is the smallest closed set that contains S
 <li>the closure of (0,1) is [0,1]
</ul>  
 
<P>The ideas of sequence, limit, and continuity from calculus are generalized into metric spaces.
At the same time, the ideas can be expressed at a slightly higher level than epsilon-delta language, 
by using open balls, and open sets.

<P>For example, <b>continuity</b> can be expressed like this:
<ul>
 <li>two metric spaces X,D and Y,D'
 <li>map f : X ➔  Y
 <li>high level: f is continuous iff the preimage of any <em>open ball</em> in Y is an open set in X.
 <li>high level: f is continuous iff the preimage of an <em>open set</em> in Y is an open set in X.
 <li>low level: f is continuous if given any f(a) ∈ Y and any p&gt;0, there is a q&gt;0 such that if x ∈ B(a,q) then f(x) ∈ B(f(a),p).
 <li>low level: f is continuous iff it maps any sequence in X (which converges to a limit L) to a sequence in Y which converges to f(L).  
</ul>  


<P>The interval [0, 0.5) is open in [0,1], but closed in R (think of open balls - Conover p84.)
 
 <P><b>Topological Space</b>
 <P>Topological spaces are defined on sets. They have three rules.
 
 <P>X is any set, and T is a collection of subsets of X.
 The collection of subsets T is a <b>topology</b> on X if the following are true:
<ul>
 <li>X and ∅ are  members of T.
 <li>The intersection of any two members of T is again in T (T is closed under finite intersections)
 <li>The union of any (possibly infinite) family of members of T is again in T (T is closed under arbitrary unions) 
</ul>  


The members of T are said to be <b>T-open subsets</b> of X, or simply <b>open subsets</b> of X.
(The rules can also be expressed using closed subsets.)

<P>A <b>topological space</b> is the pair (X,T).

<P>"It turns out that these three are the fundamental properties that open sets should satisfy
to allow us to do useful things with them, like defining continuous functions, convergence of
sequences, and so on." - Ivan Khatchatourian.

<b>Topological properties</b> are those properties which can be defined using open sets.

<P>A <b>closed subset</b> is the complement of an open set.
The closed subsets of X have properties that are a variation on the rules for topologies in general. 
The collection C of closed subsets of T satisfy (note how union and intersection are reversed here): 
<ul>
 <li>X and ∅ are  members of C.
 <li>The <em>union</em> of any two members of C is again in C.
 <li>The <em>intersection</em> of any (possibly infinite) family of members of C is again in C. 
</ul>  

<P>A subset of X may be open, closed, both (<b>clopen</b>), or neither.
X and ∅ are always both open and closed.

<P>A <b>neighbourhood</b> of <em>p</em> is a set which contains an open set which in turn contains <em>p</em>.
A neighbourhood isn't necessarily an open subset. 
Be careful: the definition of neighbourhood varies in the literature! 

<P>Open and closed maps:
<ul>
 <li>(X,U) and (Y, V) are topological spaces
 <li>m: X ➔ Y 
 <li>m is an <b>open map</b> if it maps each open set in U to an open set in V: m(u) ∈ V
 <li>m is a <b>closed map</b> if it maps each closed set in U to a closed set in V
</ul>
 
<P><b>Example topologies</b>:
<ul>
 <li>trivial [indiscrete] topology, for any X: {X, ∅}. This is the smallest number of possible subsets in a topology. 
 <li>discrete topology, for any X: P(X), the power set of X. Here, all possible subsets of X are open. This is the largest number of possible subsets in a topology.
 <li>a metric always induces a topology
 <li>a total order relation always induces a topology
 <li>ray topology on the real line {(a, ∞): a ∈ R} ∪ {∅,R}
 <li>finite-complement [co-finite] topology, for any X: U is open iff (X - U) is finite.
</ul>  
  
  
<P>There's an alternate definition due to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space#Definition_via_neighbourhoods'>Hausdorff's original scheme</a>.
It is based on <b>neighbourhoods</b>, not open sets. 
The language of that style emphasizes that topology is about 'what is near to what', without necessarily having a specified distance (as in a metric space).

<P>Jargon for when one topology is a subset of another:
<ul>
 <li>T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> are topologies on a set X. 
 <li>T<sub>1</sub> <b>smaller [weaker, coarser]</b>, and T<sub>2</sub> is <b>larger [stronger, finer]</b>: T<sub>1</sub> ⊂ T<sub>2</sub>
 <li>if T<sub>1</sub> &ne; T<sub>2</sub>, then you can say <b>strictly smaller/larger</b>
</ul>



<P><b>Continuity</b> is important both in math and physics. 
It's likely the case that almost all maps in physics are continuous.

<P><em>"In fact, continuity is probably the single most important concept in all mathematics."</em> - Robert Conover.

<P>A continuous map m: X ➔ Y <b>preserves closeness</b>: points that are close in X are mapped to points that are close in Y.

<P>Continuity can be expressed in a wide number of ways, a few of which are included below.

<P>The <b>"ε-δ" definition</b> for a function from the reals into the reals f:(D ⊂ R) ➔ R uses the absolute value metric; it can be easily generalized to a map 
between any two metric spaces:
<P>f is continuous at x<sub>0</sub> if for any ε &gt; 0 there exists a δ &gt; 0 such that |f(x) - f(x<sub>0</sub>)| &lt; ε whenever x ∈ D and |x - x<sub>0</sub>| &lt; δ.    
 
<P>Staying with metric spaces, continuity can be expressed <b>using open balls</b> like this:
<ul>
 <li>(X,d1) and (Y,d2) are metric spaces
 <li>f: (D ⊂ X) ➔ Y 
 <li>f is continuous at x<sub>0</sub> if given any ε &gt; 0 there exists a δ &gt; 0 such that: 
 <li>f(x) ∈ B(f(x<sub>0</sub>),ε) whenever x ∈ B(x<sub>0</sub>,δ)
 <li>this means that f(B(x<sub>0</sub>,δ)) ⊂ B(f(x<sub>0</sub>), ε)
</ul>

<P>Robert Conover: "<em>...it turns out that it is not the metrics themselves that are important to continuity; rather, the important things are 
the topologies induced by these metrics, and the fact that these topologies come from metrics is really of no consequence once we have them."</em>  

<P>This leads to a definition of continuity <b>using open sets</b> (and maps instead of functions):
<ul>
 <li>X and Y are topological spaces
 <li>m: X ➔ Y 
 <li>m is continuous at x<sub>0</sub> iff:
 <li>whenever V is an open subset of Y with f(x<sub>0</sub>) ∈ V
 <li>then there exists an open subset U of X such that x<sub>0</sub> ∈ U and f(U) ⊂ V.     
</ul>

<P>The composition of two continuous maps is also a continuous map.

<P>Here's <b>an even simpler definition using open sets</b>:
<ul>
 <li>X and Y are topological spaces
 <li>m: X ➔ Y 
 <li>m is continuous on X iff:
 <li>whenever V is an open subset of Y, then the preimage(V) is an open subset in X
 <li>that is, a map is continuous iff its <em>inverse</em> preserves open sets
</ul>

<P>Similar logic applies to other cases. A map m: X ➔ Y is continuous iff:
<ul>
 <li>the preimage of open sets in Y maps to to open sets in X 
 <li>the preimage of closed sets in Y maps to closed sets in X 
 <li>the preimage of each open set in a basis for Y maps to an open set in X
 <li>the preimage of each open set in a sub-basis for Y maps to an open set in X
 <li>it's continuous at every x ∈ X
 <li>for every A ⊂ X, f(~A) = ~f(A), where ~ means the closure of a set (the image of a closure is the closure of the image)
</ul>

<P>Continuity with closures reads especially nice:
<ul>
 <li>(X,T<sub>x</sub>) and (Y,T<sub>y</sub>) are topological spaces
 <li>m: X ➔ Y
 <li>m is continuous iff for every A ⊂ X: 
 <li>m(Cl<sub>x</sub>(A)) ⊂ Cl<sub>y</sub>(m(A))
 <li>Cl<sub>y</sub>(m(A)) ⊂ m(Cl<sub>x</sub>(A))
</ul>

<P>If we declare that a point <em>x</em> is "close to" a subset A ⊂ X if x ∈ Cl(A), 
then this terminology allows for a plain English description of continuity: 
<em>m</em> is continuous iff for every subset A ⊂ X, <em>m</em> maps points that are close to A to points that are close 
to <em>f(A)</em>.






<P>A <b>homeomorphism</b> ("<em>same shape</em>") is an important kind of map, since, <b>by definition, it preserves topological properties</b>.
It's defined like this:
<ul>
 <li>X and Y are topological spaces
 <li>m: X ➔ Y 
 <li>m is a one-to-one correspondence (bijective), and thus has an inverse m<sup>-1</sup>
 <li>m and m<sup>-1</sup> are both continuous
</ul>
(Some authors drop the <em>onto</em> requirement.)

<P>If a homeomorphism exists between X and Y, then the two topological spaces are <b>homeomorphic</b>, and we write X ≃ Y.

<P>Some properties that are <b>not topological</b>:
<ul>
 <li>size, distance
 <li>'curvyness'
 <li>order
</ul>

<P>Examples:
<ul>
 <li>reals with absolute value metric: [0,1] and [2,4] : homeomorphic 
 <li>reals with absolute value metric: (0,1) and R : homeomorphic
 <li>stereographic projection between the unit sphere in R<sup>3</sup> with a single point removed and the set of all points in R<sup>2</sup> : homeomorphic
 <li>reals with absolute value metric: [0,1] and (0,1) : not homeomorphic 
 <li>plane with Euclidean metric: a circle and a line segment : not homeomorphic
 <li>R<sup>n</sup> and R<sup>m</sup> (n &ne; m) with a Euclidean metric: not homeomorphic
 <li>m: [0,2pi) ➔ S<sup>1</sup>, the unit circle on the plane (usual topology): not homeomorphic (m is bijective/continous, but m<sup>-1</sup> is bijective/non-continuous; nearness is not preserved by m<sup>-1</sup>)
</ul>

<P>Homeomorphisms are analogous to:
<ul>
 <li>vector spaces : bijective linear transformations
 <li>groups/rings/fields/etc. : isomorphisms
 <li>manifolds : diffeomorphisms
</ul>


<P>Logically equivalent statements, where X and Y are topological spaces, and m: X ➔ Y: 
<ul>
 <li>m is a homeomorphism 
 <li>m is an open map 
 <li>m is a closed map 
 <li>U ⊂ X is open iff m(U) is open
 <li>U ⊂ Y is open(closed) iff its preimage is open(closed) in X
 <li>if B is a basis for X, then the image of the basis is a basis in Y   
</ul>

<P>A property is a <b>topological invariant</b> iff whenever (X, T ) and (Y, U) are homeomorphic topological spaces, one has property φ if and only if the
other has property φ.

<P>Examples of topological invariants:
<ul>
 <li>T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> separation 
 <li>Hausdorff separation
 <li>Separable
 <li> Cardinality
 <li> First countable
 <li> Second countable
 <li> Countable chain condition
</ul>

 <P>Homeomorphic spaces are essentially equivalent from a topological point of view. 
 There is a natural one-one correspondence between their open sets.
 Put another way, by relabeling the points of one set, you get the other set (and its topology).
 
 <P>"Almost all geometric studies can be classified according to the type of properties they study; in particular, these types of 
 properties are those which are preserved by certain kinds of functions.
 Topology, considered as a branch of geometry, studies properties preserved by a very special type of function, the homeomorphism." - Conover 
 
 <P>Let T be the class of all topological spaces. Then the relation R defined on T by "is homeomorphic to" is an equivalence relation on T.
 
<P>Given a topological space (X,T), a <b>basis for the topology</b> T is a collection B of subsets of X which satisfies:
<ul>
 <li> every set in B is an open set in T 
 <li> each open set in T is a union of members of B
</ul>

To note:
<ul>
 <li> The members of B are called <b>basic open sets</b> in (X,T). 
 <li> A topology can have more than one basis.
 <li> Working with a basis is usually easier than working with all open sets.
 <li> The collection B covers X: each x is in at least one member of B.
 <li> The intersection of two members of B is a union of some members of B.
 <li> X itself is the union of members of B.
 <li> Neigbourhoods can be defined using basic open sets instead of open sets.
</ul>

<P>Examples:
<ul>
 <li> R with the usual topology: all open intervals
 <li> R with the usual topology: all open rays (a, ∞)
 <li> R with the usual topology: all half-open intervals [a,b) or (a,b]
 <li> in a metric space: all open balls 
 <li> Counterexample, not a basis for R with the usual topology: all closed intervals
</ul>

<P>Out of a collection B, build a topology:
<ul>
 <li>X is any set.
 <li>B is a collection of subsets, which satisfies two conditions:
 <li>- 1) X is the union of members of B
 <li>- 2) the intersection of two members of B is a union of members of B
 <li>Define a topology on X to be T = {U ⊂ X | U is a union of members of B} 
 <li>B is then a basis for T.  
</ul>

<P>How to tell if B is the basis for a topology B*:
<ul>
 <li>X is any set
 <li>B is a collection of subsets of X
 <li>B* is the collection of all possible unions of members of B
 <li>Is B* a topology on X (for which B is the basis)? Two conditions:
 <li>1) the union of B = X
 <li>2)for B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>1</sub> in B,
 <li>and any x ∈ B<sub>1</sub> ⋂ B<sub>2</sub>,
 <li>there exists a B<sub>3</sub> in B such that x ∈ B<sub>3</sub> ⊂  B<sub>1</sub> ⋂ B<sub>2</sub> 
</ul>



<P>Sub-basis generates a basis:
<ul>
 <li>X, T is a topological space
 <li>a collection S is a sub-basis if this set is indeed a basis:  
 <li>{B|B is the <em>intersection</em> of finitely many members of S}
 <li>(that is, the collection of all finitely many intersections of S)
</ul>

<P>Items to note:
<ul>
 <li><b>a sub-basis generates using finitely many intersections, but a basis generates using arbitrary unions</b>
 <li>the members of a sub-basis are called <b>sub-basic open sets</b>
 <li>any collection of subsets of X whose union is X is a sub-basis for a topology on X
 <li>example: the set of all rays is a sub-basis
 <li>unlike the situation for a basis, <b>any collection of subsets is a sub-basis for some topology</b> 
</ul>

<P>Means of specifying a topology:
<ul>
 <li>define the open sets
 <li>define the closed sets
 <li>define a basis
 <li>define a sub-basis
</ul>

<P>Checking for continuity reduces to checking a basis or, even better, a sub-basis:
<ul>
 <li>X,T<sub>x</sub> and Y,T<sub>y</sub> are two topological spaces
 <li>B is a basis for T<sub>y</sub>
 <li>m: X ➔ Y
 <li>m is continuous iff for any member of B, its preimage is open
 <li>the same can be said of a sub-basis
</ul>

<P>A <b>local basis</b> at x:
<ul>
 <li>X,T is a topological space and x ∈ X
 <li>B<sub>x</sub> is a collection of open sets. It is a <em>local basis at x</em> iff:
 <li>for any open set U containing x, there's a B ∈ B<sub>x</sub> such that x ∈ B ⊂ U
 <li>if every x ∈ X has a <em>countable local basis</em>, then the space X is called <b>first-countable</b>
 <li>for a first-countable space X: a set F is closed in X iff any convergent sequence of points in F converges to a point in F 
</ul>

<P>A topological space is <b>second-countable</b> if the topology can be generated by a countable basis.
Every second-countable space is first-countable (but not vice versa).

<P><b>Related sets</b> for a set A ⊂ X, where (X, T) is a topological space:

<P>Ā or Cl A or cl A: the <b>closure</b> of a set A is the intersection of all closed sets that contain A.

<P>Facts about the closure of a set Ā:  
<ul>
 <li>Ā is the union of A and its boundary ∂A
 <li>Ā is a closed set
 <li>Ā is the smallest closed set containing A
 <li>Ā contains A, Ā ⊃ A  
 <li>A is closed iff A = Ā
 <li> Cl(Cl(A)) = Cl(A)
 <li> in any space (X,T), Cl(∅) = ∅ and Cl(X) = X
 <li> Cl(A ∪ B) = Cl(A) ∪ Cl(B) - generalizes to finitely many unions; if infinite unions then replace = with ⊃ 
 <li> Cl(A ⋂ B) ⊂ Cl(A) ⋂ Cl(B) - generalizes to any number of intersections
 <li> x ∈ Ā iff any open set containing x also contains an element of A
 <li> roughly,  Ā is the collection of points that A is "close to"
</ul>

<P>Examples (with the usual topology):
<ul>
 <li>R: Cl( (0,1) ) = [0,1] 
 <li>R: Cl( [0,1) ) = [0,1] 
 <li>R: Cl(Q) = R (the rationals Q)
 <li>C the complex plane: Cl( {|z| &gt; 1} ) = {|z| &ge; 1}
 <li>A = {1/n: n ∈ N}:  Ā = A ∪  ∅
 <li>Cl( {x} ) = {x}  (but not true in all topological spaces)      
</ul>

<P>A is <b>dense</b> if its closure is the whole set X: Ā = X. That is, A is "close to everything".
<P>Examples (with the usual topology):
<ul>
 <li>Q (rationals) is dense in R 
 <li>R - Q (irrationals) is dense in R 
 <li>N is not dense in R
 <li>no finite set is dense 
</ul>

 
 <P>The <b>interior</b> of A is the union of all open sets which are subsets of A:
<ul>
 <li>symbol: A&deg;, Int A, int A, or ⟨A⟩ 
 <li>A&deg; = A - ∂A 
 <li>A&deg; = X - Cl(X-A) 
 <li>if B = X - A, then A&deg; is ... 
 <li>(A&deg;)&deg; = A&deg;
 <li>(A ⋂ B)&deg; = A&deg; ⋂ B&deg; 
 <li> A is open only iff A = A&deg;
 <li>A&deg; is the largest open subset of A 
 <li>A&deg; is open
 <li>the interior is <em>dual</em> to closure: just swap ⊂ with ⊃,  and ⋂ with ∪ 
</ul>
 
<P>The <b>exterior</b> of A is the complement of Ā:
<ul>
 <li> ext A = X - Ā
 <li>it consists of the points that are in neither the set nor its boundary
 <li>ext A is open
 <li>it's the union of all open sets that are disjoint from A
 <li>it's the largest open set that is disjoint from A
 <li> ext A = int(X - A)
</ul> 

<P>The <b>boundary</b> [frontier] of A is:
<ul>
 <li> labelled ∂A or Fr A
 <li> {x|each open set containing x, that also contains points of both A and X - A}
 <li> ∂A is closed
 <li> in a metric space, d(∂A, A) = d(∂A, X - A) = 0
 <li> A is open iff have ∂A ⋂ A = ∅  
 <li> A is closed iff ∂A ⊂ A
 <li> ∂A = ∂(X - A)
 <li> Ā - ∂A = A&deg; 
</ul> 

<P>The interior, boundary, and exterior of a subset together partition the whole space into three parts.
The interior and exterior are always open, while the boundary is closed. 
 
 
 
 
<P>A <b>subspace</b> is defined alongside a <b>subspace topology [relative topology]</b> :
<ul>
 <li>X, T is a topological space
 <li>Y ⊂ X 
 <li>the subspace topology T<sub>Y</sub> is the intersection of all open sets in X with Y:
 <li>T<sub>Y</sub> = {U ⋂ Y : U ∈ T}
 <li>T<sub>Y</sub> is said to be <em>induced by</em> or <em>inherited from</em> T
 <li>the topological space Y, T<sub>Y</sub> is said to be a <em>subspace</em> of X,T
</ul>

<P>"Topological spaces found in common mathematical applications actually arise as subspaces of relatively simple spaces like 
R<sup>n</sup><sub>usual</sub>, or as spaces that are homeomorphic or locally homeomorphic to subspaces of R<sup>n</sup><sub>usual</sub>, 
subspaces of various function spaces, etc." - I. Khatchatourian

<P>Basis for a subspace of (X,T) is also defined using intersections with the subset:
<ul>
 <li>A ⊂ X 
 <li>B<sub>T</sub> is a basis for T on X
 <li>Then: B<sub>A</sub> = {B ⋂ A : B ∈ B<sub>T</sub>}
 <li>is a basis for the subspace topology on A.
</ul>

<P>Closed sets in a subspace (X,T) are also defined using intersections with the subset:
<ul>
 <li>A ⊂ X is a subspace of X 
 <li>F ⊂ A is closed in the subspace topology of A iff there exists a closed set C in X such that F = C ⋂ A
</ul>

<P>Closures in a subspace:
<ul>
 <li>A ⊂ X is a subspace of X 
 <li>if S ⊂ A, then Cl<sub>A</sub>(S) = Cl<sub>X</sub>(S) ⋂ A
</ul>

<P>An open/closed set in X may or may not be an open/closed set in a subspace A ⊂ X.
But if A itself is open/closed, then:
<ul>
 <li>if A is an open(closed) set in X, then S ⊂ A is open(closed) in A iff it's open(closed) in X 
</ul>
 
<P>"Transitivity" of subspaces: 
<ul>
 <li>X,T is a topological space
 <li>Y is a subspace of X
 <li>Z is a subspace of Y, with respect to Y
 <li>then Z is subspace of X, and has the same topology that it would have as a direct subspace of X 
</ul>


<P>An important question is "Which properties are passed on to a subspace?"





<P>One way to derive a new topology from an existing one is to use an <em>equivalence relation</em>.
(Recall that an equivalence relation defines a <em>partition</em> of a set. Conversely, a partition can be used to define an equivalence relation.)
<ul>
 <li>X,T is a topological space
 <li>R is an equivalence relation on X
 <li>for each x ∈ X, let [x] = {y∈ X: yRx} be the equivalence class for x (the items equivalent to x under R)
 <li>X/R is the set of all [x]'s; it's called a <b>quotient space</b> (when it's given the quotient topology - see below)
 <li>the <b>identification [projection] map</b> m: X ➔ X/R is defined as m(x) = [x]
 <li>using the picture of arrows and points, under m,  many points in X "collapse" onto a single point in X/R
 <li>the preimage of [x] under m isn't just x, it's everything that's equivalent to x (i.e. many things, not one)
 <li>the <b>identification topology [quotient topology]</b> is defined as:
 <li><em>under m, a set is open in X/R iff its preimage under m is open in X</em>
 <li>that is, "We put a topology on X/R by defining a subset U of X/R to be open if all elements of X contained in all the members of U form an open subset of X."
 <li>moreover, m is continuous
 <li>moreover, a subset is closed in X/R iff its preimage is closed in X
</ul>

<P>In the plane, take a rectangle bounded by:
<ul>
 <li>0 &le; x &le; 2pi
 <li>0 &le; y &le; 1
</ul>

then you can define various famous topological objects by defining various equivalence relations (identifications) involving the edges:
<ul>
 <li>cylinder: &rarr; for the horizontals; that is, (x,0)=(x,1) for all x in [0,2pi], and (x,y)=(x,y) for all points in the rectangle (one opposing pair of edges in the same direction)
 <li>torus: &rarr; for the horizontals, and &uarr; for the verticals (both pairs of edges in the same direction)
 <li>Mobius strip: &uarr; for the right-vertical, and &darr; for the right-vertical (one pair of opposite edges in the opposite directions)
 <li>Klein bottle: &rarr; for the horizontals, and &uarr; for the left-vertical, &darr; for the right-vertical (one pair of opposite edges in the same dir, the other pair in the opposite dir)
 <li>projective plane: arrows going clockwise around the edges (both pairs of opposing edges in opposite directions)
</ul>



<P><b>Product spaces</b> build on the idea of a Cartesian product of two sets, defining a set of ordered pairs.
In topology, product spaces can be defined for an arbitrary number of input sets, including an infinite number.
But in physics, it's likely the case that product spaces are formed from just two sets at a time, so I'll limit myself to that case.

<P>
<ul>
 <li>X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> are two non-empty sets 
 <li>Cartesian product X<sub>1</sub> &times; X<sub>2</sub> = {(x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>): x<sub>1</sub> ∈ X<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> ∈ X<sub>2</sub>}
 <li>X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> are called the <b>factors</b> of X<sub>1</sub> &times; X<sub>2</sub>  
 <li><b>projection map</b> p<sub>1</sub>:X<sub>1</sub> &times; X<sub>2</sub> ➔  X<sub>1</sub> is defined as p<sub>1</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>) = x<sub>1</sub> 
 <li><b>projection map</b> p<sub>2</sub>:X<sub>1</sub> &times; X<sub>2</sub> ➔  X<sub>2</sub> is defined as p<sub>2</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>) = x<sub>2</sub>
</ul>

<P>The <b>product topology</b> is defined using a sub-basis. 
 Remember that a basis generates a topology via <em>unions</em>, but a sub-basis generates a basis using <em>intersections</em>: 
<ul>
 <li>X<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>2</sub> are two topological spaces 
 <li>U<sub>1</sub> ∈ T<sub>1</sub> and U<sub>2</sub> ∈ T<sub>2</sub> are open sets
 <li>the <em>product topology</em> on X<sub>1</sub> &times; X<sub>2</sub> uses preimages (under the projections) of the open sets in T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> as its sub-basis:
 <li> {p<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>(U<sub>1</sub>), p<sub>2</sub><sup>-1</sup>(U<sub>2</sub>) : U<sub>1</sub> ∈ T<sub>1</sub> and U<sub>2</sub> ∈ T<sub>2</sub>}
 <li> the above can be modified to use bases B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> instead of open sets U<sub>1</sub> and U<sub>2</sub>  
</ul>

<P>The key idea is the preimages under the projections of the open sets. 
These are called <b>strips</b>. 
Pictorially, it's very useful to draw in a model in R<sup>2</sup>:
<ul>
 <li>use X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> as the two axes
 <li>the open sets U<sub>1</sub> and U<sub>2</sub> correspond to open intervals on the axes
 <li>the projections p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub> map vertical and horizontal strips (areas) onto U<sub>1</sub>, U<sub>2</sub> (respectively)
 <li>that can be stated in reverse using preimages:
 <li>p<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>(U<sub>1</sub>) = U<sub>1</sub> &times; X<sub>2</sub> (a rectangular area or strip)
 <li>p<sub>2</sub><sup>-1</sup>(U<sub>2</sub>) = X<sub>1</sub> &times; U<sub>2</sub> (a rectangular area or strip)
 <li>the intersection of strips defines an open area in the plane, corresponding to a sub-basis being used to generate a basis    
</ul> 

<P>Instead of a sub-basis, you can use a basis instead, for the product topology:
<ul>
 <li>product of open sets: {U<sub>1</sub> &times; U<sub>2</sub> :  U<sub>1</sub> ∈ T<sub>1</sub> and U<sub>2</sub> ∈ T<sub>2</sub>}
 <li>product of sets in a basis: {B<sub>1</sub> &times; B<sub>2</sub> :  B<sub>1</sub> ∈ ℬ<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> ∈ ℬ<sub>2</sub>}, where the ℬ's are bases
</ul> 

<P>More:
<ul>
 <li>the product of open sets U<sub>1</sub> &times; U<sub>2</sub> is open in the product space (same for closed)
 <li>an open set in X<sub>1</sub> &times; X<sub>2</sub> need not be the product of open sets; rather, it is the <em>union</em> of sets which are the products of open sets (same for closed)
 <li>closure, with A<sub>1</sub> ∈  X<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> ∈  X<sub>2</sub> : Cl(A<sub>1</sub>) &times; Cl(A<sub>2</sub>) = Cl(A<sub>1</sub> &times; A<sub>2</sub>)
 <li>interior, with A,B ∈  X : Int(A &times; B) = Int(A) &times; Int(B)
 <li>the product of subspaces is a subspace of the product (you get the same topology "from both methods of getting there")
 <li>the projection maps are continuous
 <li>X<sub>1</sub> and  X<sub>2</sub> are each homeomorphic to a subspace of X<sub>1</sub> &times;  X<sub>2</sub>  
</ul> 

<P>The composition of continuous maps is also continuous. 
For product spaces, the converse is also true:
<ul>
 <li>X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> are topological spaces
 <li>p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub> are the projection maps for the product space  
 <li>m:Y ➔ X<sub>1</sub> &times; X<sub>2</sub>  
 <li>then m is continuous iff p<sub>1</sub> ∘ m and p<sub>2</sub> ∘ m are continuous
 <li>that is, a map into a product space is continuous iff its composition with the projections are continuous 
</ul> 
 




<P>In topology, the idea of <b>separation</b> between sets is a bit stronger than being disjoint. 
There are different levels of separation, which form a hierarchy of "increasing separation."

<P>X,T is a topological space and x, y are two distinct points in X :
<ul>
 <li>(neighborhood of x = set that contains an open set that contains x)
 <li><b>T<sub>0</sub></b>: there's an open set that contains one but not the other for <em>at least one</em> of x and y
 <li><b>T<sub>1</sub></b>: there's an open set that contains one but not the other for <em>both</em> of x and y
 <li><b>T<sub>2</sub></b>: there's an open set that contains one but not the other for <em>both</em> of x and y, AND the two open sets are disjoint
</ul>

<P>Confusing: some authors use neighborhood instead of open set!

To note:
<ul>
 <li>the T<sub>2</sub> property is extremely common, and to be expected in all physics contexts
 <li>every metric space is T<sub>2</sub>
 <li>totally ordered sets are T<sub>2</sub>
 <li>every subspace of a T<sub>0</sub>(T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>) space is also T<sub>0</sub>(T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>) 
 <li>if space X is homeomorphic to space Y, then if X is T<sub>0</sub> (T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>) then so is Y
 <li>T<sub>1</sub>: for each point x, {x} is a closed set (all singletons are closed)
 <li>T<sub>1</sub>: a sequence can converge to more than one limit! In a T<sub>2</sub> space, sequences have a max of one limit
 <li>T<sub>1</sub>: every finite subset of X is closed
 <li>T<sub>1</sub>: the complement of every finite subset of X is open
 <li>T<sub>1</sub>: every subset of X is the intersection of all the open sets containing it
 <li>T<sub>2</sub>: products of T<sub>2</sub> spaces are T<sub>2</sub>, but the same doesn't apply to quotient spaces
 <li>T<sub>2</sub>: compact sets are always closed
</ul>

<P>A topological space is said to be <b>regular</b> if points can be separated from closed sets:
<ul>
 <li>X, T is a topological space
 <li>given any closed set F ⊂ X, and some point x not in the closed set F
 <li>you can find disjoint open sets that contain x and F 
</ul>

<P>A topological space is <b>T<sub>3</sub></b> if it's both T<sub>1</sub> and regular.




<P>A <b>compact</b> set, roughly speaking: 
<ul>
 <li>is <em>closed</em>: it includes its limits
 <li>is <em>bounded</em>: it doesn't go off to infinity
 <li>it has <em>no holes</em> in it 
</ul>

<P>Compactness lets you replace an infinite number of open sets with a finite number of open sets.

<P><em>"What compactness does for us is allow us to turn infinite collections of open sets into finite collections
of open sets that do essentially the same thing. Compact spaces can be very large, as we will
see in the next section, but in a strong sense every compact space acts like a finite space."</em> - Ivan Khatchatourian.

<P><em>"Two of the most important properties in topology are compactness and being T<sub>2</sub>."</em> - Robert Conover.

<P>Cover, sub-cover, and the cardinality of a sub-cover:
<ul>
 <li>X, T is a topological space
 <li>S ∈  X
 <li> {U<sub>i</sub>}, i ∈  I is an <b>open cover</b> (or just cover) of S iff S = ∪ U<sub>I</sub>   
 <li> {V<sub>j</sub>}, j ∈ J is a <b>sub-cover</b> of S in U iff V is a subcollection of U (that is V ⊂ U), <em>and</em> V itself is also a cover of S  
 <li> the cardinality of a subcover is important:
 <li> S is <b>compact</b> iff every open cover of S has a <em>finite</em> sub-cover
 <li> S is <b>Lindelof</b> iff every open cover of S has a <em>countable</em> sub-cover (a weaker property)
 <li> an entire topological space is compact iff every open cover of it contains a finite sub-cover
 <li> S is <em>not</em> compact if there's <em>at least one cover</em> of S that does <em>not</em> have a finite sub-cover
</ul>

<P>With R and the usual topology:
<ul>
 <li>[0,1] is compact
 <li>(0,1) is not compact
 <li>[0,infinity) is not compact
 <li>R itself is Lindelof, but not compact since it's unbounded
</ul>
 

<P>With R and the usual topology:
<ul>
 <li><b>Heine-Borel theorem</b>: any cover of [0,1] contains a finite sub-cover
 <li>in symbols:
 <li>V<sub>I</sub> is a collection of open subsets of R
 <li>V<sub>I</sub> is a cover of [0,1], that is [0,1] ⊂ ∪V<sub>I</sub>
 <li>then, there are finitely many sets V<sub>i</sub> in V<sub>I</sub> such that [0,1] ⊂ ∪V<sub>i</sub>, i=1 to n
</ul>

<P>For A ⊂  R with the usual topology, the following are logically equivalent:
<ul>
 <li>A is compact
 <li>A is closed and bounded
 <li>every sequence in A has a convergent subsequence (that converges to a point in A)
 <li>every real-valued continuous function on A is bounded 
 <li>every infinite subset of A has a cluster point in A
</ul>

<P>From Wald's Appendix A: 
<ul>
 <li>A.1: a closed interval [a,b] is compact in R with the usual topology
 <li>A.2: if X is Hausdorff and A ⊂ X is compact, then A is closed
 <li>A.3: if X is compact and A ⊂ X is closed then A is compact
 <li>A.4: a subset of R is compact iff it's closed and bounded
 <li>A.5: if X is compact and m: X ➔ Y is continuous, then m(Y) = {y∈Y | y=m(x)}  is compact
 <li>A.6: if X is compact and m: X ➔ R is continuous, then m is bounded and attains its max and min values
 <li>A.7: if X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> are compact, then X<sub>1</sub> &times; X<sub>2</sub> with the product topology is compact (<b>Tychonoff theorem</b>) 
 <li>A.8 a subset of R<sup>n</sup> is compact iff it's closed and bounded
</ul>
 
<P>More: 
<ul>
 <li>if X is compact and m: X ➔ Y is continuous and onto, then Y is also compact
 <li>a subset of a compact set is not necessarily compact; for example, compare [0,1] and (0,1)
</ul>

<P>The <b>Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem</b> (A.9) is a relation between compactness and sequences:
<ul>
 <li>X, T is a topological space, and A ⊂ X
 <li>if A is compact, then every sequence in A has an accumulation point in A
 <li>if X is second-countable and every sequence in A has an accumulation point in A, then A is compact
 <li>if X is second-countable, A is compact iff every sequence in A has a convergent subsequence with a limit in A
</ul>

<P>A <b>refinement</b> of a cover:
<ul>
 <li>X, T is a topological space, and {O<sub>i</sub>} is an open cover of X
 <li>{V<sub>j</sub>} is also an open cover of X 
 <li>we say {V<sub>j</sub>} is a <em>refinement</em> of {O<sub>i</sub>}
 <li>if for each V<sub>j</sub>, there's an O<sub>i</sub> such that V<sub>j</sub> ⊂ O<sub>i</sub>
 <li>(note how this differs from the idea of a sub-cover)    
</ul>

<P>A cover {O<sub>i</sub>} of a topological space is <b>locally finite</b>:
<ul>
 <li>if each x ∈ X has an open neighborhood W (an open set containing x) such that: 
 <li>only <em>finitely many</em> O<sub>i</sub> intersect with W, O<sub>i</sub> ⋂ W &ne; ∅
</ul>

<P>A topological space X is <b>paracompact</b> if every open cover of X has a locally finite refinement.
R<sup>n</sup> and S<sup>m</sup> are paracompact.

<P>Skipping ahead a bit to manifolds:
<ul>
 <li>if a manifold M is paracompact, then: 
 <li> (1) M admits a Riemannian metric
 <li> (2) M is second-countable (the topology can be generated by a countable basis)
 <li> #2 implies that M is covered by a locally finite, countable set of charts (&psi;<sub>i</sub>, O<sub>i</sub>), and the closure of each chart Cl(O<sub>i</sub>) is compact  
 <li> conversely, if M satisfies either (1) or (2), then M is paracompact
</ul>

<P>For a paracompact manifold:
<ul>
 <li>there exists a <em>partition of unity</em> 
 <li>it allows one to globalize many local results
 <li>it allows one to define integration over the manifold
</ul>


<P>A set is <b>connected</b> if it can't be seen as the union of two disjoint open sets.
A set is <b>disconnected</b> if it can indeed be seen as such a union.

<P>For R (usual topology):
 <ul>
  <li>a subset of R is connected iff it's an interval
  <li>the only clopen sets in R are the empty set and R itself
 </ul>

<P>Several equivalences, all expressed negatively. X is a topological space, and A and B are <b>non-empty</b> sets: 
<ul>
 <li>X cannot be written as A ∪ B, where A and B are disjoint and open
 <li>X cannot be written as A ∪ B, where A and B are disjoint and closed
 <li>X cannot be written as A ∪ B, where both Cl(A) ⋂ B = ∅ and A ⋂ Cl(B) = ∅
 <li>X doesn't contain a non-empty clopen subset (both open and closed)
 <li>if A is a subset of X, and A is not X or ∅, then A has a non-empty boundary ∂A &ne; ∅ 
</ul>

<P>Connectedness is preserved by continuous functions:
<ul>
 <li>X, Y are topological spaces
 <li>m: X ➔ Y is a continuous map
 <li>if X is connected, then m(X) is connected
 <li>thus, a connected space cannot be homeomorphic to a space that's not connected; such a pair of spaces can never be topologically the same
</ul>

<P>X &times; Y is connected iff X and Y are connected.
<P>If X is a connected space and R is an equivalence relation on X, then the identification space X/R is connected.
<P>In R<sup>n</sup>, a subset A is <b>convex</b> if given any x, y in A, the closed segment xy is also in A. That is, segments between points in A stay in A.
<P>If n &gt; 1, then R<sup>n</sup> is not homeomorphic to R. More generally, R<sup>n</sup> isn't homeomorphic to R<sup>m</sup> when the dimensions differ, n &ne; m.

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set
 In practice, however, open sets are usually chosen to provide a notion of nearness that is similar to that of metric spaces, without having 
 a notion of distance defined. In particular, a topology allows defining properties such as continuity, connectedness, and compactness, which 
 were originally defined by means of a distance.
 
 The most common case of a topology without any distance is given by manifolds, which are topological spaces that, near each point, 
 resemble an open set of a Euclidean space, but on which no distance is defined in general.
 
 
 Thus, rather than speaking of a concrete Euclidean metric, one may use sets to describe points close to x. This innovative idea has far-reaching 
 consequences; in particular, by defining different collections of sets containing 0 (distinct from the sets (−ε, ε)), one may find different 
 results regarding the distance between 0 and other real numbers. For example, if we were to define R as the only such set for "measuring distance", 
 all points are close to 0 since there is only one possible degree of accuracy one may achieve in approximating 0: being a member of R. Thus, we find 
 that in some sense, every real number is distance 0 away from 0. It may help in this case to think of the measure as being a binary condition: all 
 things in R are equally close to 0, while any item that is not in R is not close to 0.
 
 The union of any number of open sets, or infinitely many open sets, is open.[2] The intersection of a finite number of open sets is open.
 A set may be both open and closed (a clopen set).
 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space
...is a topological space where for any two distinct points there exist neighbourhoods of each which are disjoint from each other.
Of the many separation axioms that can be imposed on a topological space, the "Hausdorff condition" (T2) is the most frequently used and discussed. 
It implies the uniqueness of limits of sequences, nets, and filters.
 
Almost all spaces encountered in analysis are Hausdorff; most importantly, the real numbers (under the standard metric topology on real numbers) 
are a Hausdorff space. More generally, all metric spaces are Hausdorff. In fact, many spaces of use in analysis, such as topological groups and 
topological manifolds, have the Hausdorff condition explicitly stated in their definitions.
